&lt;font color="black"&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
 -Linear regression is an algorithm that shows a linear relationship      between an independent variable and a dependent variable.

&lt;h1 align="center"&gt; 4 assumptions associated with a linear regression model&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;font color="black"&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
- Linearity: The relationship between X and the mean of Y is linear.
- Homoscedasticity: The variance of residual is the same for any value of X.
- Independence: Observations are independent of each other.
- Normality: For any fixed value of X, Y is normally distributed.
